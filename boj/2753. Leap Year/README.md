## [2753. **Leap Year**](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2753)

**Problem**

Given a year, write a program that outputs 1 if it's a leap year, and 0 if it's not.

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or it is divisible by 400.

For example, the year 2012 is a leap year because it is divisible by 4 but not by 100. The year 1900 is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400. However, the year 2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 400.

<br/>

**Input**

- The first line contains a year. The year is a natural number greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 4000.

**Output**

- Output 1 on the first line if it's a leap year, and 0 if it's not.
