**Problem**

Sangsu's younger brother Sangsu is really bad at math. Sangsu has a problem reading numbers. To help his brother, who is not good at math, Sangsu gave him a problem comparing the sizes of numbers. Sangsu wrote two three-digit numbers on the blackboard. Then he asked his brother to tell him which number is bigger.

Sangsu's brother reads numbers differently from others. For example, if Sangsu wrote 734 and 893 on the blackboard, his brother would read these numbers as 437 and 398. Therefore, his brother would say that the larger number is 437, which is the larger of the two numbers.

Given two numbers, write a program to output Sangsu's answer.

<br/>

**Input**

- The first line contains two numbers A and B that Sangsu wrote on the blackboard. The two numbers are distinct three-digit numbers, and they do not contain the digit 0.

**Output**

- Output Sangsu's answer on the first line.
