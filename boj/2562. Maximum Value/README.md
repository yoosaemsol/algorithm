## [2572. **Maximum Value**](https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/2562)

**Problem**

When you are given nine different natural numbers, write a program to find the maximum among them and determine which position (or which number in the sequence) that maximum value occupies.

For example, given nine different natural numbers:

3, 29, 38, 12, 57, 74, 40, 85, 61

The maximum among them is 85, and it occupies the 8th position in the sequence.

**Input**

- Nine natural numbers are given, one on each line. The given natural numbers are all less than 100.

**Output**

- Output the maximum value on the first line, and on the second line, output the position (or number) where the maximum value is located.
