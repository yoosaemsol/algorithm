### Bubble Sort

* It simply checks adjacent elements and swaps their positions if they are not in order.

* The name "bubble" sort comes from the resemblance of its form to bubbles when comparing adjacent elements.

* It is one of the inefficient sorting algorithms with a time complexity of O(N^2). ðŸ˜•

âœ… Once a single step is performed, the largest element moves to the very end!

âœ… Therefore, in the next step, the data that has moved to the end is excluded from the sorting.

### Code

```js

function bubbleSort(arr) {
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
        let temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j+1];
        arr[j+1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
}


const arr = [9,8,2,4,3]; 
bubbleSort(arr);

console.log(arr); // [ 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 ]

```
